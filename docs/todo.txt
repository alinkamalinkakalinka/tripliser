Version 1.0.1

PropertyMappingTest

Version 1.1...

Max graph size (particularly for CLI + large CSV)
Bag, seq & list!
Implement alternative = true
	Basic logic...
		if alt=true
			if value found for name="x"
				ignore alternative
			else
				process alternative just like any mapping
	Note: this means *order matters*
Introduce 'report scope="x"' to reporting?
Simplify addPropertiesForResourceAndMapping
Some integration tests for XML reports?
setLogger(Logger) ... (composite reporters)
Convert DI to use Guice
CSV as input format (psuedo XPath?)
SQL as query language
Parameters (injected 'constants')
Prefix validation: seems to be hard, no libraries for doing it, spec is complicated:
	http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-NameStartChar
Internal resource validity (resource must exist in generated graph)
	internalResource="true"?
Standalone mapping validation? XSD?
